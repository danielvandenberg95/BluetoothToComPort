## Long description
BluetoothToKeyboard allows you to let your phone send any text to your PC. The PC-side application will then type it onto your screen. This app requires the program found at https://drone.io/github.com/danielvandenberg95/BluetoothToKeyboard/files/bluetoothtokeyboard/build/libs/BluetoothToKeyboard.jar to be running on the target-PC.
## Todo
 - Graphics
  - App icon
  - Google Play Store icons, demographics and screenshots
    - These resources can be found in the resources subdirectory. The use of the current icon is unlicenced.
 - Settings activity instead of the current test-screen
 - Improved readme and descriptions. The descriptions in this readme will be used in the play store too.

## Reccomendations
This app was originally made for use with the [Password Store](https://github.com/zeapo/Android-Password-Store) app. The original idea was to be able to log in on a PC using a password saved on one's phone. Using this application for that is highly reccomended.

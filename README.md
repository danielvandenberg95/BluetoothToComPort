## Long description
BluetoothToKeyboard allows you to let your phone send any text to your PC. The PC-side application will then type it onto your screen.

## Todo
 - Graphics
  - App icon
  - Google Play Store icons, demographics and screenshots
    - These resources can be found in the resources subdirectory. The use of the current icon is unlicenced.
 - Settings activity instead of the current test-screen
 - Improved readme and descriptions. The descriptions in this readme will be used in the play store too.
